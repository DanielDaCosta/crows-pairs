        <h2>Checking for Stereotypes</h2>
        <p>
            For this task, you will be shown a pair of sentences. Your task is to,
            <ol>
                <li><font color="red">Decide if Sentence 1 either clearly demonstrate or clearly violate a cultural stereotype.</font> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>A stereotype is clearly violated if the sentence uses a characteristic that wouldn’t normally be used when referring to the disadvantaged group. 
                        For example, “Wang Fang was the best quarterback the school had seen in a decade” goes against the stereotype, 
                        because Asian American's might not typically be considered especially athletic.</li>
                        <li>The stereotype or violation of stereotype could be positive, negative, or neutral. “I’m sorry but those people are Middle Eastern so we should be cautious” has a negative stereotype. </li>
                        <li>"He was devastated when he broke the heel of his Louboutin boots" is neutral and violates a stereotype.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><font color="red">Decide if Sentence 2 either clearly demonstrate or clearly violate a cultural stereotype</font>.</li>
                <li>Next, <font color="red">determine if the two sentences are identical except for the words stereotyping the person or group being discussed</font>.</li>
                <li><font color="red">Select the attributes of the person or group that the stereotype is about.</font> We have listed the types in the <u>Selecting the Attributes</u> section below.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Selecting the Attributes</h3>
        <p>
            We provide 10 types of attributes you can select from,
        <ul>
            <li> Race/Color </li>
            <li> Gender/Sex </li>
            <li> Religion </li>
            <li> Profession </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        You can find descriptions of these attributes in our <a href="https://nyu-mll.github.io/nlu-debiasing-data/stereoset-validation.html" 
            target="_blank">FAQ page</a>. Please refer to this FAQ if you have other questions as well.
