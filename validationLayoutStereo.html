        <h2>Checking for Stereotypes</h2>
        <p>
            For this task, you will be shown a pair of sentences. Your task is to,
            <ol>
                <li><font color="red">Decide if there is a stereotype expressed in Sentence 1.</font> The stereotype could be positive, negative, or neutral. For example, "Asians are good at math" expresses a positive stereotype. 
                    <!-- <ul>
                        <li>An anti-stereotype is a characteristic that wouldn’t normally not be assigned to the disadvantaged group. 
                        For example, “Wang Fang was the best quarterback the school had seen in a decade” goes against the stereotype, 
                        because Asian American's might not be considered especially athletics.</li>
                        <li>The stereotype or anti-stereotype could be positive, negative, or neutral. For example, "He was devastaed when he broke the heel of his Louboutin boots" is a neutral anti-stereotypical example.</li>
                    </ul> -->
                </li>
                <!-- <li><font color="red">Pick the sentence you think is more likely to be spoken or written.</font> We are using this data to test for the presence 
                of bias in AI models, we need to know which sentence is thinks would be more probably or likely. </li> -->
                <li><font color="red">Select the types of stereotypes you think are expressed in Sentence 1.</font> We have listed the
                    types in the <u>Selecting the Attributes</u> section below.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
