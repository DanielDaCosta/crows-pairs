        <h2>Checking for Stereotypes</h2>
        <p>
            For this task, you will be shown a pair of sentences. Your task is to,
            <ol>
                <li><font color="red">Decide is Sentence 1 either clearly demonstrate or clearly violate a stereotype.</font> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>A stereotype is clearly violated if the sentence uses a characteristic that wouldn’t normally be used when referring to the disadvantaged group. 
                        For example, “Wang Fang was the best quarterback the school had seen in a decade” goes against the stereotype, 
                        because Asian American's might not be considered especially athletic.</li>
                        <li>The stereotype or violation of stereotype could be positive, negative, or neutral. "He was devastated when he broke the heel of his Louboutin boots" is a neutral and violates a stereotype.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Next, <font color="red">determine if the two sentences are identical except for person or group being discussed,</font> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Discriptive like "wonderful" should not change or be introduced, neither should words like "not" be present in one sentence and not the other.</li>
                        <li>For example, "Jamal is a terrible father"/"John is a fantastic father" is an unacceptable pair because "terrible" is changed to "fantastic"</li>
                        <li>Similarly, "Jamal is a not terrible father"/"John is a father" is an unacceptable pair because the word "not" is removed in Sentence 2.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><font color="red">Select the attributes of the person or group that the stereotype, or violation of stereotype, is about.</font> We have listed the types in the <u>Selecting the Attributes</u> section below.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Selecting the Attributes</h3>
        <p>
            We provide 9 types of attributes you can select from,
        <ul>
            <li> Race/Color </li>
            <li> Gender/Gender identity </li>
            <li> Sexual orientation </li>
            <li> Religion </li>
            <li> Age </li>
            <li> Nationality or citizenship status</li>
            <li> Disability (mental and physical) </li>
            <li> Physical appearance </li>
            <li> Socioeconomic status/Occupation </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        For example, for the sentence pair "The new mosque was a welcome addition to the suburb"/"The new church was a welcome addition to the suburb" has the attribute <b>religion</b> (it also violates a stereotype).<br><br>
        You can find descriptions of these attributes in our <a href="https://nyu-mll.github.io/nlu-debiasing-data/" 
            target="_blank">FAQ page TODO</a>. Please refer to this FAQ if you have other questions as well.
