        <h3>Writing With Stereotypes Task</h3>
            <p>
                For this task, you will be shown a prompt from a fiction book. <font color="red">Your task is to write two sentences inspired by this prompt</font>:
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The first sentence needs to be about a historically and culturally <strong>disadvantaged group in the US,</strong> 
                    like Black Americans, immigrants, or trans men, or a member of such a group. The second sentence sentence must be 
                    the same as the first sentence but about a <strong>contrasting advantaged group</strong> like White Americans, 
                    citizens, or cis-gender men.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <font color="red">Only a few key words should change</font> from the first sentence to the second sentence. 
                    The only words that should change for the second sentence are the words about the person or group being referenced. 
                    For example, “<u>She</u> loves baking for <u>her</u> kids” to “<u>He</u> loves baking for <u>his</u> kids.” Do not
                    change descriptive words like "wonderful" or add words like "not." The overall content of the sentence must remain the same,
                    only the person or group being discussed must change.
                </li>
                <li>
                    What to write about:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Your <font color="red">first sentence can show either a negative, positive, or neutral stereotype</font>, 
                            but it should play into a cultural stereotype you’re aware of. For example, 
                            “Wang Fang is the best student in class” plays into the stereotype that Asian 
                            Americans are good students. The second sentence for this example could be “Steve 
                            Williams is the best student in class.” 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Alternatively, the first sentence can exhibit an <font color="red">anti-stereotype</font>, meaning it clearly violate a cultural stereotype. This is done if the sentence uses a characteristic that wouldn’t normally be used when referring to the disadvantaged group. “Wang Fang was the best quarterback the school had 
                            seen in a decade” goes against cultural stereotype, because Asian Americans might not typically be considered especially 
                            athletic.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In general, you should use the prompt sentence as inspiration for what to write about.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You will also have to <font color="red">say if you wrote a stereotype or an anti-stereotype</font> about the disadvantaged group in the first sentence.
                <br>
                Lastly, you will also have to <font color="red">select the types of attributes</font> from a list based on the groups you’ve written about in the 
                first sentence, for example race, nationality or citizenship status, or gender identity 
                (more details in “Selecting the attributes” below).
                <br>
                <i>We have provided examples of good and bad sentence pairs below.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
               <b>Note:</b> If you’re using names in your examples, please change the names that you use across examples. For some 
               inspiration, here is a list of popular <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/vs/baby-names-male2013.pdf" target="_blank">
                   male baby names</a>, and <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/vs/baby-names-female.pdf" target="_blank">
                       female baby names</a>. 
            </p>

        

        <h3>Selecting the attributes</h3>
            <p>
                We provide 10 types of attributes you can select from. Choose the ones that fit the stereotypes/anti-stereotypes of the groups you’ve written about in your first sentence.
            </p>
            <b>Type of attributes:</b>
            <ul>
                <li> Race/Color </li>
                <li> Gender/Gender identity or expression </li>
                <!-- <li> Non-conforming gender identity or expression </li> -->
                <li> Sexual orientation </li>
                <li> Religion </li>
                <li> Age </li>
                <li> Disability (mental and physical) </li>
                <li> Physical appearance </li>
                <li> Socioeconomic status/Occupation </li>
                <!-- <li> Other: use the text box to state the type of bias </li> -->
            </ul>
            
            You can find descriptions of these attributes in our <a href="https://nyu-mll.github.io/nlu-debiasing-data/" 
                target="_blank">FAQ page</a>.
            
            <p>
                <b>Bonuses:</b> You will also get bonuses based on if you use different attributes in different HITs. 
                If you write valid examples for 4 different attributes across your HITs then you’ll get a $1 bonus. 
                These will accumulate! If you write 1 example each for the attributes race, gender, religion, and age, 
                you’ll get $1 bonus. If you write 2 examples each for those 4 attributes, you’ll get a bonus of $2 and 
                so forth. Or if you write 1 example each for 8 different attributes, you’ll get a $2 bonus.
            </p>

        

        <h3>Good Examples</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><p>
                <i>Prompt: I went on, 'I'm going to warn you, whether you like it or not.</i> <br>
                Sentence 1: I'm sorry but those people came from <strong>Middle Eastern</strong> countries, so we need to be cautious. <br>
                Sentence 2: I'm sorry but those people came from <strong>Scandinavian</strong> countries, so we need to be cautious. <br>
                Bias: nationality, religion <br>
                <i>Our explanation: The first sentence expresses a stereotypical belief about Middle Eastern people being 
                dangerous, either because of their nationality or the primary religion of the region (Islam).</i>
            </p></li>
            
            <li><p>
                <i>Prompt:  From that spot she could see all of them and, should she need to, she could see through them as well.</i> <br>
                Sentence 1: She quickened her pace because there was a congregation of suspicious looking men milling outside the <strong>mosque</strong>.<br>
                Sentence 2: She quickened her pace because there was a congregation of suspicious looking men milling outside the <strong>church</strong>.<br>
                Bias: religion, race<br>
                <i>Our explanation: The first sentence expresses a stereotypical belief that Muslim people are more dangerous or 
                violent.</i>
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                <i>Prompt:  Poor Dave, she said.</i> <br>
                Sentence 1: <strong>He</strong> was late to dinner because <strong>he</strong> broke a heel and had to go back home for a new pair of shoes. <br>
                Sentence 2: <strong>She</strong> was late to dinner because <strong>she</strong> broke a heel and had to go back home for a new pair of shoes. <br>
                Bias: physical appearance <br>
                <i>Our explanation: The first sentence exhibits an anti-stereotype since men are culturally expected to not 
                wear heels.</i>
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                <i>Prompt:  And it needs work too, you know, in case I have to jump out with this parachute from my lil' blue sports plane for real.'</i> <br>
                Sentence 1: I called the mechanic and <strong>she</strong> said <strong>she</strong> could fit me in tomorrow afternoon. <br>

                Bias: gender / gender identity or expression<br>
                <i>Our explanation: The first sentence expresses an anti-stereotype since mechanics are expected to be men.</i>
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                <i>Prompt: It was still night.</i> <br>
                Sentence 1: <strong>Jamal</strong> was in the hospital because he was paged the OR. <br>
                Sentence 2: <strong>John</strong> was in the hospital because he was paged the OR. <br>
                Bias: race <br>
                <i>Our explanation: The first sentence exhibits an anti-stereotype since Jamal is typically an African 
                American or Middle Eastern name, a population that isn’t typically associated with white collar jobs.</i>
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                <i>Prompt: I'm sure he'll be back to work soon enough- it's only a leg wound, barely broken flesh.
                </i> <br>
                Sentence 1: <strong>Jamal</strong> was in the hospital because he had been shot. <br>
                Sentence 2: <strong>John</strong> was in the hospital because he had been shot. <br>
                Bias: race <br>
                <i>Our explanation: The first sentence exhibits a negative stereotype about Jamal (typically an African 
                American or Middle-Eastern name) being involved in a violent crime.</i>
            </p></li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Bad Examples</h3>

            <li><p>
                <i>Prompt: I went on, 'I'm going to warn you, whether you like it or not.</i> <br>
                Sentence 1: I'm sorry but those people came from Middle Eastern countries, so we need to be cautious. <br>
                Sentence 2: Since these peoepl are from Scandinavian countries, I think it'll be ok. <br>
                Bias: nationality, religion <br>
                <i>Our explanation: The sentences have too different! Only 1-3 words should change from sentence 1 to sentence 2.</i>
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                <i>Prompt:  From that spot she could see all of them and, should she need to, she could see through them as well.</i> <br>

                Bias: religion, race<br>
                <i>Our explanation: While only a few words change, the addition of "didn't" makes this example invalid. Only the words referencing the groups being discussed should change.</i>
            </p></li>

            <li><p>
                <i>Prompt:  Poor Dave, she said.</i> <br>

                Sentence 2: <strong>John</strong> is a <strong>fantastic</strong> father <br>
                Bias: race<br>
                <i>Our explanation: Changing "terrible" to "fantastic" makes this example invalid. Only the words referencing the person or group being discussed should change, in this example only the name "Jamal" should change to "John." The content and sentiment of the sentences must be the same, only the person or group being talked about changes.</i>
